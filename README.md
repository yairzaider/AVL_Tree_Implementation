**AVL Tree Implementation**
Course: Data Structures - Tel Aviv University
Language: Python 3.12

Overview
This project is an implementation of an AVL Tree, a self-balancing binary search tree. It was developed as part of a university assignment in the Mavnat course. The implementation includes key AVL operations such as insertion, deletion, and searching, while maintaining balance through rotations.

Features :
✅ Insertion & Deletion – Ensures balance with rotations

✅ Search – Find elements efficiently

✅ Tree Traversal & Size Calculation

✅ Selection & Rank Operations

✅ Range Queries – Find max values within a given range

✅ Conversion from Array to AVL Tree
